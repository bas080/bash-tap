# Bash Tap

Minimal tap utilities for (ba)sh scripts.

## Examples

Bash tap is tested with its own testing utilities. These tests also function
as examples on how to use bash tap. The tests are located in the `./t/`
directory.

The following is an example of a test where it isn't clear how many tests will
be run. It possible to have bash tap append the plan at the end of the test
run.

`$ cat ./t/example.append-plan.t`

`$ ./t/example.append-plan.t`

See the `./t/` directory for more examples.

A test that will output tap based on the exit code.

`$ ./t/example.process.t`

## Documentation

The ./README.md is generated using [barkdown][2]. To regenerate simply run
 `$ ./README.bd > README.md`.

## Tests

Tests are located in prove's default ./t directory. This is how to run them:

`$ prove # runs all tests`

`$ ./t/example.aliases.t # runs a single test`
